# David Ramos

- Hi! My name is David, and I'm a student at Mt. Eden High School. I'm currently taking AP Computer Science in my Junior year of high school. I've learned so much about this class like what are variables and arrays. I really enjoy creating projects because it was super fun. Outside of coding, I enjoy wrestling, hiking, hanging out with friends, and listening to music from artist like "The Marias" and "Mac Demarco".

- This project is the final assignment for my AP Computer Science Principles class. The project it's making a website that tells who I am, what I’ve learned this year, and the projects I’ve made over these past months in class. Throughout the class, I’ve learned what are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and programming fundamentals like arrays, loops, variables, binary, and functions and how to use these when coding. Because of making this web page, it has helped me improve in this class by learning how to code better.

- My profolio has a home page, what I have learned in this class, a about me section, what are my goals, my projects throughout this class year, and extras that are, my favorite website and a picture of my school.

-My Projects:
Tic-Tac-Toe: A two player game where players take turns placing X and O on a grid. The first to get three in a row wins. It's competitive, fun, and easy to play.
Clock App: A digital clock app that displays the current time and lets us change the background color.
Red Light Green Light: A game inspired by Squid Game where the player must move only when the light is green. If you move when the light is red, you're out! It’s fun and challenging.
